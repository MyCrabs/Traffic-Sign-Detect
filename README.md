## Introduction

This project aims to accurately detect traffic signs in images and videos using the YOLO v8 object detection model. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection system that is known for its speed and accuracy.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MyCrabs/Traffic-Sign-Detect8.git
cd traffic-sign-detection-yolov8
```
## Dataset

This dataset includes 17 class: Speed limit 10, speed limit 20, speed limit 30, speed limit 40, speed limit 50, speed limit  60, speed limit 70, speed limit 80, speed limit 90, speed limit 100, speed limit 110, speed limit 120, not turn left, not turn right, slow, opposite site, stop. A part of this data are colleted in DaNang city. The others from Kaggle. You could get dataset here: [Visit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thanhduy190903/data-pbl-last)

## Note
Replace dataset.yaml with the path to your dataset configuration file, and adjust the epochs parameter as needed.
